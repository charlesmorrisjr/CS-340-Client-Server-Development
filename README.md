# CS-340-Client-Server-Development

When developing a project, it's important to write modular and adaptable code. In my project for this course, I created a CRUD Python module separate from the dashboard module. The advantage of writing code this way is that I can easily reuse and adapt the CRUD module to other projects by simply copying it over and modifying it. If I want to add more features, I could update the CRUD module, and all projects that use the module would have access to those features.

When I approach a problem as a computer scientist, I gather all available information about the problem. If the problem is too complex, I break it into smaller problems to make troubleshooting more manageable. I may also think about the end goal and work backward. When building a full-stack application like this project, more parts can go wrong. The front and back end must function properly for the application to run correctly.

Computer scientists can perform many roles, including software development, algorithm design, and computer system design. Having a solid foundation in computer science helps developers, designers, and engineers create software that is efficient, effective, and fulfills user requirements.
