When developing a project, it's important to write code that is modular and adaptable. In my project for this course, I created a CRUD Python module that was separate from the dashboard module. The advantage of writing code this way is that I can easily reuse and adapt the CRUD module to other projects by simply copying it over and modifying it. If I want to add more features, I could update the CRUD module, and all projects that use the module would have access to those features.

When I approach a problem as a computer scientist, I start by gathering all available information about the problem. If the problem is too complex, I break it down into smaller problems to make troubleshooting more manageable. I may also think about the end goal and work backwards. When building a full-stack application like this project, there are more parts that can go wrong. The front-end and the back-end must both function properly for the application to run correctly.

Computer scientists are capable of many roles, including software development, algorithm design, and computer system design. Having a solid foundation in computer science helps developers, designers, and engineers create software that is efficient, effective, and fulfills user requirements.
